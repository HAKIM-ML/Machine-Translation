# Machine Translation: Bengali to English and English to Bengali

## Overview

This project implements a custom Transformer architecture for machine translation between Bengali and English languages. The model has been trained on a dataset consisting of 5 million sentence pairs.

## Features

- Translate text from Bengali to English.
- Translate text from English to Bengali.
- Includes a Streamlit web application for easy interaction with the translation model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. To use the translation model:
    - Import the model into your Python script.
    - Call the appropriate function to translate text from Bengali to English or from English to Bengali.

2. To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command:
    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
